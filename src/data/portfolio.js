        • Object Detection Pipeline: Developed a YOLO-based pipeline for object detection in video frames, enabling keyword-based clip
          generation and summary creation enhancing content analysis and annotation.
        • Text Extraction & Summarization: Automated text extraction and summarization from PDFs and websites using open-source
          Large Language Models (LLMs) and advanced NLP techniques.
        • DataProcessing & Analysis Pipelines: Designed and optimized data pipelines using Python, MongoDB, and FastAPI, enhancing
          data handling and reporting efficiency. Applied data analysis and visualization techniques to generate insights, improving reporting
          accuracy.
        • Blog Recommendation System: Created a scalable recommendation system with Dask and BERT embeddings for semantic text
          analysis. Implemented ChromaDB and Flask API for scalable data querying and dynamic recommendations.
        • NLP&AIExploration: Explored Llama 2, Llama 3, and LangChain for advanced NLP and AI applications.
